sanskrit Documentation
======================

This is the **sanskrit** package, which provides utilities for working with
Sanskrit on various levels of abstraction:

- on the **sound** level: checking whether vowels are short or long, performing
  common transformations, applying and undoing sandhi rules, and getting basic
  metrical information.

- on the **word** level: checking whether a word exist, inflecting a stem to
  produce new words, and analyzing a word for its inflectional information.

- on the **paragraph** level: undoing sandhi rules in a real passage and
  analyzing the words that the paragraph contains.
